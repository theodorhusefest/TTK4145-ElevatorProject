## IO-Module

This module acts as the interface between the program and the physical, and is neccesary to make the elevator move. The module was handed out as a part of exercise 5 in TTK4145, and is responsible for setting motordirection, reading floor-sensors, reading button-signals as well as setting and clearing lights.
